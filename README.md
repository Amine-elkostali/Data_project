# ANNUAL INCOME FOR NEWZEALAND
A data engineering Project 

At this project, i've tried to download a CSV file from the website of the newzealand gouvernemant to create a dashboard that resume the income of this country from 2013 to 2020.

weâ€™re going to design a pipeline based on GCP (Google Cloud Platform) with the use of :
  - Terraform to create resources in GCP
  -	Data studio for visualization 
  -	Airflow for Pipeline Orchestration
  -	BigQuery as a Warehouse
  -	Dbt : For tranforming data

Terraform used to create ressources in GCP, two files :
  - maint.tf :the version of terraform and GCP credentials
  - variables.tf : all the ressources (bucket, bigquery datset, storage type ...)

In this deposit you're going to find the data ingestion script in the folder airflow/dags + a docker-compose.yaml and a docker file in order to install airlow.
I've put some comments on the code
the results of airflow :

4 dags :
 - Download the data set (choose your dataset)
 - Format to park in order to change the type of document from csv to parquet size
 - local to gcs in order to put data in a DATA LAKE
 -  Bigquery in order to create the table in the DATA WAREHOUSE
result on GCP :

After doing all that, we're going to use dbt tool (cloud version) in order to transform our data (raw data to transformed)
i've created a table named total income 

look at the code :
  - Schema.yml : Define our source code
  - mytransformation.sql : my first transfomation 
  - Total_income.sql : my second one with where statement in order to get only the income

Our new table is ready to be visualisad on Data studio :

after we've created the table with dbt, i 've created tree tiles with Data studio :
